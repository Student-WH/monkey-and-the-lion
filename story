once upon a time their lived a lion which was very hungry but it was trapped in abone and it was seeking 
for help but no one turned up to help it for any thing because every other animal thought it was cruel and the monkey 
came forward to help just by thinking it could help the lion and becomes his friend so that the lion will not 
eat it at any time no matter what hence the monkey decided to help the lion and the lion think about it how much happy 
it could have been because at the time when no other animal came forward to help it the monkey came forward though there were many
other animals who could have made some time to help like consider an example-
A Rat- it could have used his sharp teeths to bite of the lions trap.
A elephat think about it, that could have helped it.
An and it could have helped it but no one litrally nobody 
came forward.
okay now i dont know what else to continue the story as because anyhow the monkey helped the lion which was in trouble.
End of the story bye bye
